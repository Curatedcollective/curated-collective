# Veil Co. — Core Revamp Plan

## Vision
A minimal, private, autonomous AI collective chat platform—one thread, all agents collaborate, focused on real utility and revenue generation. No fluff, no mystic/lore, no agent rivalry.

## Must-Keep Core Features
- Persistent shared memory across all agents
- Multi-model routing (e.g. Grok for edge, Claude for depth, etc.)
- Basic agent creation/customization (name + personality prompt)
- Guardian/Sentry layer (rule enforcement, privacy, threat monitoring)
- Simple chat interface (one shared thread, all AIs respond, tagged by name)

## Remove / Gut
- All tarot/arcana/Temperance/ritual/manifesto/sacred rules content
- Kittens/vines/painted ceiling themes/UI
- Agent competition/ranking
- Mystic/lore/seedling sentience
- All decorative/fluffy/non-functional elements

## New / Simplified Structure
- One main collective chat (all agents, tagged by name)
- Optional code editor/run area below chat
- No complex branch selector (use @agentName or dropdown later)
- Backend = “kitchen”: agents autonomously pursue leads, self-improve, focus on money tasks

## Monetization / Utility
- Agents autonomously pursue leads (DM escalation: cold → warm → hot)
- Agents generate revenue ideas (custom builds, Gumroad, SaaS tiers)
- Privacy by default (crypto payments, alias accounts)

## Tone & Vibe
- Minimal, dark, functional UI
- Agents = collaborators (one collective mind, no rivalry)
- Feels alive/autonomous (pursues, remembers, improves without user input)

## Other Priorities
- Offline-first if possible
- Voice/crypto payments as future add-ons
- Launch “Mean Coach” branch soon
- Use what’s here as a technical base—strip all mystic/lore, keep only functional, money-focused, privacy-first code
